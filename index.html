    <h1>History..</h1>
    <p>1. David C Evans was born on February 24, 1924 and attended the University of Utah, receiving his Bachelor in Physics in
    1949, and later his Doctorate in Physics in 1953. He was then employed by the Bendix Corp. as Senior Physicist in the
    Computer Division, then promoted to Director of Engineering. He was responsible for researching, developing, and the product design of commercial computing systems and for
    processing systems for the military and industrial applications. Two projects he directed at this company were the G-20
    computing system and the G-15 computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Evans joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Utah in 1962. He later became
    the University's first Director of Computer Science in 1965, and during his years there at the University of Utah, he
    pioneered time-shared computing systems and real-time continous-tone computer graphics. Before Evans would leave his
    full-time position in 1966, he would have researched syntax-directed computers, constraint processor declarative
    languages, and memory systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. In 1966, Evans joined the faculty of the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was the principal investigator of a project aimed at improving computer-aided problem solving capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Evans founded Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp. in 1968 along with Ivan Sutherland, serving as CEO until his retirement.
    The first offices for the company were in a building on the University of Utah campus. The company was one of the first
    developers of interactive graphics, with the first product produced by the company being the Line Drawing System, a
    high-speed interactive graphics display system patterned after a prototype based on research at Harvard University.
    Other computer graphics systems have been developed at the company such as Novoview, which was a family of computer
    image generators which would produce visual scenes for pilot training. More products like Digistar, which would adapt
    computer graphics for projection displays, were also made by this company.
